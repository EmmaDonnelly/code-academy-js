//Programming is simply a way to give instructions to the computer.
//In Getting Started, we learned about if / else statements.
//We want to keep learning ways to instruct the computer to perform repeatable tasks efficiently.

//Let's briefly review! Use an if / else to check how fast you're driving.
//If speed is greater than 80, use console.log to print "Slow down"
//Otherwise (else), use console.log to print "Drive safe"

var speed = 65;

if (speed > 80) {
	console.log("Slow down");
}
