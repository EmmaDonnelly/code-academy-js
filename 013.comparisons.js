//So far we've learned about three data types:
//- strings (e.g. "dogs go woof!")
//-numbers (e.g. 4, 10)
//-booleans (e.g. false, 5 > 4)
//Now let's learn more about comparison operators.

//List of comparison operators:
//- > Greater than
//- < Less than
//- <= Less than or equal to
//- >= Greater than or equal to
//- === Equal to
//- !== Not equal to

//Try to use each of the operators above.
//Choose the correct comparison operator to make each of the four statements print out true.

// Here is an example of using the greater than (>) operator.
console.log(15 > 4); // 15 > 4 evaluates to true, so true is printed.

// Fill in with >, <, === so that the following print out true:
console.log("Xiao Hui".length < 122);
console.log("Goody Donaldson".length > 8);
console.log(8*2 === 16);

//Answers: true, true, true, true
