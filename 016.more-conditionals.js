//Now let's practice using if/else statements. Do as much as you can by yourself, but if you need a reminder, click the "Stuck? Get a hint!" button below.

//01. Write an if/else statement, just like we did in the last exercise. Here's what the outline of the code looked like:

if (condition)
{
    // if condition is true
    // do this code
}
else // "otherwise"
{
    // do this code instead
}

//02. If your condition is true, use console.log to print "The condition is true".
//03. Otherwise (else) when it is false, use console.log to print "The condition is false".
//04. Make sure your condition evaluates to false, so that your program prints out "The condition is false".

// Remember, the order and punctuation matter.
// If you get an error, check carefully, line by line.

if (10 < 5)
{
    console.log("The condition is true")
}
else // "otherwise"
{
    console.log("The condition is false")
}

//answer: Thsi comdition is false.
