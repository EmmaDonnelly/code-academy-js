//Programming is like writing a list of instructions to the computer so it can do cool stuff with your information.
//Programs can't yet make your bed, but they can do math, keep track of your bank account, or send a message to a friend.
//To do any of these actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a prompt.

//Examples:

prompt("What is your name?");
prompt("What is Ubuntu?");

//Use the prompt command to ask the user where they are from. Check out the examples above for how to do this!

prompt("Where are you from?");

//dialogue box pops up with question and text box, returns answer as string
//e.g. London
