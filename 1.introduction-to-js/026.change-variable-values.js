//So far, we've seen
//a. how to create a variable
//b. how to use a variable

//Let's now see how to change a variable's value. A variable's value is easily changed. Just pretend you are creating a new variable while using the same name of the existing variable!

//Example:
//var myAge = "Thirty";
//Say I had a birthday and I want to change my age.
//myAge = "Thirty-one";
//Now the value of myAge is "Thirty-one"!

//Follow the instructions on line 1, line 3, line 5 and line 8. We're using this method to show you the order in which you tell the computer what to do is very important.

// On line 2, declare a variable myName and give it your name.
var myName = "Emma";
// On line 4, use console.log to print out the myName variable.
console.log(myName);
// On line 7, change the value of myName to be just the first 2
// letters of your name.
var myName = "Em";
// On line 9, use console.log to print out the myName variable.
console.log(myName);
