//Well done! Now, computers are very literal. Syntax needs to be in exactly the right place for the computer to understand the code.
//As you get started with programming, we will teach you many syntax rules. This is sort of like the grammar of programming languages. Grammar first, then programming poetry!

//There are many mistakes in this code. Find them and fix them all.
//You are doing what's called "debugging," a term popularized by Grace Hopper when she literally removed a moth from her computer.

//// The computer doesn't worry about extra spaces between words or brackets
// It just cares about the order of where things are placed
// and that you have used the right characters (){}[]"";

// For extra help, a program called a 'linter' is checking your code
// and will put a red 'x' next to the first line that contains errors
