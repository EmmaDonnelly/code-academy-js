//We saw basic math before. The basic math symbols we learned in school work here.
//Even the order in which the computer understands the math is the same as in school!

//Code:
//01. ( ): control order of operations
//02. * and /: multiplication and division
//03. - and +: subtraction and addition

//Examples:
//01. 100/10 evaluates to 10
//02. "Jane".length + 5 evaluates to 9
//03. 5*(3+1) evaluates to 20

//01. Complete the missing bits of code to construct the if / else statement. Make the condition evaluate to true.
//02. Finish the else statement by printing out the string "Error Error Error" to the console.
